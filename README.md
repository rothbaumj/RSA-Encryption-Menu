RSA is a cryptographic algorithm used to secure data. It stands for Rivest-Shamir-Adlemen, named after it's inventors. It is based on the fact that computers struggle when factoring very large composite number. The algorithm is fundamentally made up of key generation, encryption, and decryption. The encryption involves selecting two large prime numbers and inputting them into various algorithms to encode a given message using a public key which can then be decoded using a private key, which you'll see in the upcoming project. For this project I implemented various functions to encrypt and decrpyt messages such as the Extended Euclidean Algorithm. Combining these functions allowed me to create a main menu function that allows users to perform various tasks with RSA, including encoding and decoding messages, breaking encrypted ciphers, and generating prime numbers to use for encryption. This user-friendly interface condenses this project into an easy to understand tool that also demonstrates the practical applications of the RSA algorithm.
