RSA is a cryptographic algorithm used to secure data. It stands for Rivest-Shamir-Adlemen, named after it's inventors. It is based on the fact that computers struggle when factoring very large composite number. It is fundamentally made up of key generation, encryption, and decryption. The encryption involves selecting two large prime numbers and inputting them into various algorithms to encode a given message using a public key which can then be decoded using a private key, which you'll see in the upcoming project. For this project, my foundational knowledge regarding RSA and cryptography, gained from previous assignments, facilitated my understanding of the various components and functions involved. My approach involved implementing each function used in RSA individually, ensuring its correctness and understanding it's role in the big picture. This process allowed me to build a robust and involved final custom feature that worked from the base of the project. To enhance the project, I chose to implement a relatively simple main menu function for the custom feature that allows users to perform various tasks with RSA, including encoding and decoding messages, breaking encrypted ciphers, and generating prime numbers to use for encryption. This user-friendly interface condensed the project into an easy to understand tool that also demonstrates the practical applications of the RSA algorithm.
